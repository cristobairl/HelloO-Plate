# HelloO-Plate  
A Gordon Ramsay-Inspired AI Chatbot for Food and Restaurant Recommendations  

---

## About the Project  
HelloO-Plate was developed during **HackUSF 2025** as a prototype AI chatbot built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
The goal was to create a food and restaurant recommendation chatbot that delivers suggestions in a Gordon Ramsay–inspired, humorous tone.  

Although the project was not completed during the hackathon, it served as a strong learning experience in AI integration, front-end development with Streamlit, and prompt design using the Gemini API.
