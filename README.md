## About the Project  
HelloO-Plate was developed during **HackUSF 2025** as a concept for a web-based AI chatbot that gives food and restaurant recommendations with a Gordon Ramsay–inspired personality.  

The goal was to combine humor with AI-driven interaction — creating a chatbot that could give food advice while keeping users entertained.  
Although the prototype was not completed during the hackathon, it served as a valuable learning experience in front-end development, API usage, and prompt engineering.

## Motivation  
This project was built to explore how personality can be embedded into AI responses while still keeping them practical.  
It was an opportunity to practice building a chatbot interface and working with the **Gemini API** under a short, competitive time frame.

## Features (Planned / Partially Implemented)  
- AI-powered food and restaurant suggestions using the Gemini API  
- Gordon Ramsay–style personality and tone  
- Simple front-end design built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- User input field and chatbot response area

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **API:** Gemini API  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, GitHub Pages
