# HelloO-Plate  
A Gordon Ramsay-Inspired AI Chatbot for Food and Restaurant Recommendations  

---

## About the Project  
HelloO-Plate was developed during **HackUSF 2025** as a prototype AI chatbot built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
The goal was to create a food and restaurant recommendation chatbot that delivers suggestions in a Gordon Ramsay–inspired, humorous tone.  

Although the project was not completed during the hackathon, it served as a strong learning experience in AI integration, front-end development with Streamlit, and prompt design using the Gemini API.  

---

## Motivation  
This project was created to explore how personality and humor can be added to AI-driven interactions while maintaining practical value.  
It also provided an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of connecting a large language model API to a Python-based web interface.  

---

## Features (Planned / Partially Implemented)  
- AI-powered food and restaurant recommendations  
- Gordon Ramsay–style tone and sarcasm  
- Interactive web-based front end built with Streamlit  
- Integration with the Gemini API for natural language responses  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Streamlit  
- **API:** Gemini API  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub  

---

## Challenges and Learnings  
- Integrating the Gemini API with Streamlit  
- Designing prompt templates for consistent AI tone  
- Handling API keys securely  
- Managing time and scope under a 24-hour hackathon deadline  
- Understanding Streamlit’s component structure and state management  

---

## Future Improvements  
- Implement a proper recommendation engine using live restaurant data  
- Add memory for contextual conversations  
- Improve the UI layout and responsiveness  
- Deploy the app publicly through Streamlit Cloud or GitHub Pages  

---

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cristobairl/HelloO-Plate.git
   cd HelloO-Plate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run hello_plate.py
   ```

*Make sure you have a valid Gemini API key stored in your environment variables.*

## Example Output  
**User:** Where should I eat tonight?  
**HelloO-Plate:** If you're thinking fast food again, I’ll lose it. Try that sushi place downtown and act like you’ve got taste for once.  

---

## Challenges and Learnings Recap  
- Built experience using APIs inside Streamlit.  
- Learned to integrate AI response handling and prompt structure in Python.  
- Strengthened understanding of deploying local AI prototypes with limited time.  
- Improved debugging and feature planning skills during a hackathon environment.  

---

## Future Improvements (Planned After Hackathon)  
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud with a clean UI.  
- Add advanced prompt memory for multi-turn conversations.  
- Extend functionality with real restaurant lookup via Google Maps API.  
- Add custom modes for different personalities or tone levels.
